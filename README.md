Mostly understanding the components of a Counter-Strike demo. Answering these questions to start:


### Round-Level Analysis
1. **Rounds and Outcomes**:
   - How many rounds were played in the match?
   - What is the win rate of each team (Terrorists vs. Counter-Terrorists)?
   - Identify rounds where the bomb was planted but not defused.

2. **Round Durations**:
   - What is the average duration of a round?
   - Which round was the shortest, and which was the longest?

### Player Performance
3. **Kills and Deaths**:
   - Who had the most kills in the match?
   - How many players achieved multi-kills (e.g., double, triple, or more) in a single round?

4. **Headshots**:
   - What percentage of kills were headshots?
   - Who had the highest headshot percentage?

### Weapon Analysis
5. **Weapon Usage**:
   - Which weapon was used the most across all rounds?
   - What are the kill counts for each weapon type (rifles, SMGs, pistols, etc.)?

6. **Clutch Plays**:
   - Identify rounds where a single player clutched a 1vX situation.

### Event-Based Analysis
7. **Grenade Usage**:
   - How many grenades (smokes, flashes, HE, molotovs) were thrown in the match?
   - Identify rounds with the highest grenade usage.

8. **Bomb Events**:
   - How many times was the bomb planted?
   - Which players planted the bomb most often?

### Spatial Analysis
9. **Heatmaps**:
   - Where did most kills occur on the map? (If spatial data is available)
   - Which bomb site was planted on most often?

10. **Movement**:
    - Who traveled the most distance in the game?
    - Which player had the fastest average movement speed?

### Intermediate Challenges
11. **Economy Analysis**:
    - What was the average starting money for each team per round?
    - Identify rounds where a team won despite having an economic disadvantage.

12. **Damage Statistics**:
    - Who dealt the most total damage across all rounds?
    - How does the average damage dealt compare between players on each team?
   


But I would also like to build a model to display how a teams win probability changes as the round progresses.

Currently working on Survival Analysis of players in rounds.
